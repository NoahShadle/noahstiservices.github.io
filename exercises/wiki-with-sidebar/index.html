                <p>
                    This article is about the relaunched game, also known 
                    as A Realm Reborn. For the defunct original release, see 
                    Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV[b] is a massively multiplayer online 
                    role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by 
                    Square Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and 
                    released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows in 
                    August 2013, it replaced the failed 2010 version, with 
                    subsequent support for PlayStation 4, macOS, 
                    PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Final Fantasy XIV 
                    is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years 
                    after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity which 
                    ended the original version. In the Calamity, the elder 
                    primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient space 
                    station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the player 
                    character of the original version escaped, reappearing 
                    at the start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements its 
                    recovery, the player must fend off a reignited 
                    invasion from the Garlean Empire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and 
                    critical failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi 
                    Wada announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would 
                    assume control and address the game's flaws. The new 
                    team both continued to develop and improve the original 
                    version, and secretly worked on a completely new 
                    replacement. This new game, codenamed "Version 2.0", used 
                    a new engine, improved server infrastructure, and 
                    revamped gameplay, interface, and story. The original 
                    version shut down in November 2012, followed by an 
                    alpha test for Version 2.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relaunched game released to largely positive 
                    reception; critics praised its solid mechanics and 
                    progression, and commended Yoshida for an unexpected 
                    recovery. After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix 
                    attributed the 2014 return to profitability partly to 
                    the game's strong sales and subscriber base. By October 
                    2021, it had gained over 24 million registered players, 
                    and become the most profitable Final Fantasy 
                    game to date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has received 
                    regular updates since release, including four major 
                    expansion packs: Heavensward (2015), Stormblood (2017), 
                    Shadowbringers (2019), and Endwalker (2021). A 
                    fifth expansion pack, Dawntrail, is to be 
                    released in July 2024.

                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent 
                    world where players can interact with each other and 
                    the environment. Players create and customize their 
                    characters for use in the game, including name, race, 
                    gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in 
                    the original release, players may only choose to be a 
                    Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples 
                    of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable.[2] 
                    Players must also select a game server for each 
                    character. While all supported languages are available 
                    on every server, data centers are located in specific 
                    regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan, and Oceania) 
                    to reduce latency between client and server, and players 
                    are advised to choose a server in their region.[3] 
                    Regardless of server or language, players can use a large 
                    library of automatically translated game terms and 
                    general phrases, allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.[4]

                        PC and home console versions use a unified user 
                        interface and control scheme. Any combination of a 
                        keyboard, mouse, and game controller may be used; 
                        for console players, wireless or USB keyboard and mouse 
                        are required for the former. On PC and macOS, the game 
                        defaults to drag and drop windows, while on the console 
                        versions of XIV, the default interface resembles the 
                        PlayStation 3's XrossMediaBar.[5] This bar is used to 
                        access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. 
                        The head-up display for both versions includes a message 
                        log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. 
                        The UI offers extensive customization options.[6]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actions and battle commands differ between PC, macOS 
                        and console versions. The PC and macOS versions supports 
                        both point and click and keyboard input for commands or 
                        macros. Macro commands are customizable sequences of 
                        actions that allow players to execute desired abilities 
                        at a specific time. The home console versions instead 
                        map the action bar and macros to the "Cross Hotbar"—sets 
                        of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These are the 
                        grouped and accessed through a combination of the shoulder 
                        buttons and the directional pad or the face buttons. 
                        Using each shoulder button to cycle through the cross 
                        sets, players have quick access to commands. 
                        This interface is also available to PC and macOS 
                        players who use controllers.[5]

                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by gaining experience 
                    points (EXP) and acquiring stronger equipment. After 
                    gaining enough XP, the character will "level up", 
                    improving their statistics, enhancing the character's 
                    performance and often learning new actions. Primary 
                    sources of experience points in Final Fantasy XIV include 
                    completing quests, exploring instanced dungeons, 
                    participating in Full Active Time Events (FATEs), and 
                    slaying monsters in the world.[7] Quests, including the 
                    "main scenario" questline, are generally short, specific 
                    tasks given to the player by non-player characters which 
                    reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario quests 
                    progresses the overarching plot of the game. Some quests 
                    are repeatable, either "daily" quests repeatable each 
                    day, or "Levequests", which consume "leve allowances" 
                    that the player slowly accrues over time. Dungeons often 
                    require multiple players to form a party to enter, but 
                    the Duty Support system enables the player to play 
                    certain dungeons alone, supported by computer-controlled 
                    party members. Some dungeons are for lower-leveled 
                    players to gain EXP quickly while others are for 
                    experienced players to collect rare items, equipment, 
                    and currency.[8] The Duty Roulette system randomly 
                    assigns the player to an accessible dungeon, and once 
                    per day, awards additional bonus EXP scaled to character 
                    level on completion.[9] FATEs permit large groups of 
                    players, whether or not they are in a party, to 
                    participate in a shared task in the world. 
                    These location-specific events include battles 
                    with notorious monsters, defending locations, 
                    escorting non-player characters, culling wildlife, 
                    and assaulting enemy fortresses, among other 
                    types.[8] Finally, each enemy the player kills 
                    provides EXP, with further EXP available from the 
                    Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of specific 
                    creatures. At maximum level, character progression 
                    focuses entirely on acquiring stronger equipment, 
                    raising the character's "item level". This equipment 
                    can be gained through a variety of sources including 
                    endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal battles, 
                    and elite mark hunts.[10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these player versus environment (PvE) 
                    challenges, various forms of player versus player (PvP) 
                    combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV. The Feast was an arena 
                    featuring structured four-versus-four battles where a 
                    player could register with up to three teammates to 
                    challenge another four-person team. This mode was removed 
                    in patch 6.1, when it was replaced with Crystalline
                     Conflict,[11] which consists of two teams of five 
                     competing to seize control of and push a crystal 
                     which starts at the middle of the arena to each team's 
                     goal point. The second type, Frontlines, is a large 
                     battleground in which players form teams of up to 24 
                     characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance 
                     to one of three Grand Companies and the team which 
                     reaches the target number of points first wins 
                     the match. Multiple modes are available, each with 
                     differing locations and rulesets. Within the game, 
                     Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military 
                     exercises between the three nations with the ulterior 
                     goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in 
                     magical artifacts.[12] The third type, Rival Wings, 
                     is a battle arena mode where players manipulate minion 
                     waves and pilot mechs to destroy enemy objectives.

                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is set on Etheirys, a fictional world of 
                    diverse environments across multiple continents, focused 
                    on the region of Eorzea.[22] Eorzea features four 
                    prominent city-states: Gridania, in the heavily-forested 
                    Black Shroud; Ul'dah, a trade-centric sultanate in arid 
                    Thanalan; Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy on the island of 
                    Vylbrand; and Ishgard, an isolationist theocracy in 
                    snowy, mountainous Coerthas. A land bridge links Eorzea 
                    to two other continents to the east, which have largely 
                    been conquered by the Garlean Empire. Other societies 
                    include indigenous tribes, such as Sylphs and Kobolds; 
                    Sharlayan, a scholarly city; and Ala Mhigo in eastern 
                    Eorzea, annexed twenty years prior by the Garlean 
                    Empire.[23] Facing Garlean invasion, Ishgard withdrew 
                    from the Eorzean Alliance, leaving it defunct. 
                    The once-vibrant Mor Dhona region was devastated 
                    during the previous Garlean campaign.[24] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eorzean history is divided into prosperous "Astral" 
                    eras, and disastrous "Umbral" eras caused by great 
                    Calamities.[25] The First Umbral Era marked the end of 
                    the age of gods.[26] The Twelve, guardian deities of 
                    Eorzea, retreated from direct mortal contact. As society 
                    recovers from Umbral eras, new Astral eras begin. 
                    Under the hegemonic Allagan Empire of the Third Astral 
                    era, technological development reached its zenith, 
                    including aerospace construction. As each Calamity was 
                    linked to one of the six fundamental elements—air, 
                    lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water—the Sixth Astral 
                    Era was expected to last forever, but five years ago, 
                    the Garlean Empire triggered the Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity.[26]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Garlean scientists working on Project Meteor 
                    weaponized the lesser moon Dalamud. Under Legatus 
                    Nael van Darnus, they would annihilate Eorzea by 
                    crashing the moon, exterminating all opposition.[27] 
                    The Alliance reunited in response, reviving their 
                    Grand Company militaries. Adventurers defeated van 
                    Darnus but could not stop Dalamud's descent. At the 
                    Battle of Carteneau Flats in Mor Dhona, Dalamud revealed 
                    itself as an ancient Allagan prison for the primal dragon 
                    Bahamut; his escape triggered the Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity.[28] Louisoix Leveilleur called upon the 
                    Twelve to imprison Bahamut, but failed; before he 
                    sacrificed himself to defeat Bahamut, he sent the 
                    adventurers "beyond the reach of time" for when they 
                    were needed again.[29] Meanwhile, the Empire became 
                    paralyzed by a succession crisis as the elderly 
                    Emperor Solus fell ill.[30]

                    The player character is an Eorzean adventurer during the 
                    Seventh Umbral Era who joins one of the Grand Companies: 
                    Gridania's Order of the Twin Adder, under Elder Seedseer 
                    Kan-E-Senna; Ul'dah's Immortal Flames, under Flame General 
                    Raubahn Aldynn; and the Maelstrom of Limsa Lominsa under 
                    Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn.[31] Their allies include 
                    Minfilia and her Scions of the Seventh Dawn, a rebuilt 
                    Sixth Astral Era organization uniting Louisoix's Circle 
                    of Knowing and Minfilia's Path of the Twelve.[32] Members 
                    include Thancred, Yda, Papalymo, Urianger, and Y'shtola. 
                    Y'shtola often represents Final Fantasy XIV in crossovers 
                    like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call and Dissidia 
                    Final Fantasy NT.[33][34] Louisoix's twin grandchildren, 
                    Alphinaud and Alisaie, follow his example to aid Eorzea. 
                    Finally, Cid Garlond heads Garlond Ironworks, a technology 
                    company providing airships, weapons, and infrastructure 
                    to the Alliance.[32]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Garlean antagonists include Legatus Gaius van Baelsar 
                    of the XIVth Imperial Legion and his lieutenants, Livia 
                    sas Junius, Rhitahtyn sas Arvina, and Nero tol Scaeva. 
                    The tribes also threaten the uneasy peace by summoning 
                    primals, aetherial deities which drain the land's 
                    life-sustaining energy.[35] Both are manipulated by 
                    the Ascians, hooded immortals hellbent on awakening 
                    their dark god Zodiark, imperiling all of Hydaelyn.[36]

                <p>
                    The game opens with a vision of the player character 
                    defeating a masked, black-robed man. The adventurer 
                    awakens shortly before arriving at the starting city, 
                    Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Returning players 
                    from the original version appear in a column of light. 
                    Through odd jobs and tenacity, the player joins the 
                    city's Adventurer's Guild, and is favorably compared 
                    to the "Warriors of Light" who vanished in the Seventh 
                    Umbral Calamity. The adventurer thwarts attacks by 
                    mysterious masked men and earns the attention of the 
                    Scions. Minfilia reveals the player's visions are the 
                    Echo, a power marking chosen representatives of 
                    Hydaelyn, the deity for whom the world is named.

                <p>
                    Freshly inducted, the adventurer and Thancred 
                    investigate abductions and crystal thefts in 
                    Thanalan by the Amalj'aa tribe, who capture the 
                    player for their primal, Ifrit, to enthrall, but 
                    the Echo blocks Ifrit's "tempering". Instead, the 
                    adventurer defeats the primal, and is hailed a 
                    hero, courted by all three Grand Companies. 
                    During memorial services for the Battle of 
                    Carteneau, the player meets Alphinaud and 
                    Alisaie, who part over disagreement about 
                    such nationalist displays' purpose. The 
                    Scions send the adventurer to the Black 
                    Shroud to forge ties with the Sylphs, a 
                    peaceful tribe whose radical faction has 
                    summoned Ramuh against the Garleans. While 
                    rescuing the Sylph elder, the adventurer 
                    encounters another masked man, Lahabrea, a 
                    leader of the mysterious Ascians. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minfilia sends the player to thwart Kobold efforts to 
                    summon Titan. The Scions seek advice from retired 
                    primal-fighting Company of Heroes. After a series of 
                    trials disguised as banquet preparations, the Company's 
                    leader reveals the way. The adventurer defeats Titan, 
                    learning that Lahabrea is aiding Gaius van Baelsar who 
                    has renewed his designs on Eorzea. The adventurer returns 
                    to the Scions' headquarters to find slaughter: Minfilia 
                    and others were captured by Garleans, and the remaining 
                    Scions slain. After funeral rites for the fallen, 
                    Alphinaud returns to recruit the adventurer, aiming 
                    to rebuild the Scions and defeat the freshly-summoned 
                    Ixali primal, Garuda. To confront Garuda in her own 
                    domain, they must awaken the memories of an amnesiac 
                    Cid Garlond. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cid, Alphinaud, and the adventurer travel to 
                    Coerthas, territory of reclusive Ishgard, seeking Cid's 
                    lost airship, the Enterprise. After befriending 
                    Isghardian commander Haurchefant Greystone and 
                    foiling a heretic plot, they recover the 
                    Enterprise from a fortress overrun by dragons. 
                    Cid, aided by the adventurer's Echo, regains 
                    his memories as a Garlean engineer, Eorzean 
                    defector, and genius inventor. The adventurer 
                    acquires a rare crystal to cut through Garuda's 
                    vortex, and the two fight until Garuda torments 
                    Kobold and Amalj'aa prisoners of war into resummoning 
                    Titan and Ifrit. However, Gaius and Lahabrea intercede 
                    with the Ultima Weapon, an ancient Allagan warmachine, 
                    which consumes all three primals to increase its power. 
                    At Lahabrea's urging, Gaius plans to conquer Eorzea using 
                    the Weapon, but the Ascian intends to trigger a 
                    Calamity with it.[37]
                </p>
                <p>
                    After recovering additional members, the Scions 
                    rescue Minfilia and the others, learning that Lahabrea 
                    has possessed Thancred. Intruding on an Alliance 
                    leadership meeting, Alphinaud and Minfilia persuade 
                    them to choose resistance instead of surrender. The 
                    Scions join the Alliance in a massive counteroffensive, 
                    Operation Archon. The adventurer assaults Gaius' 
                    stronghold, the Praetorium, where Gaius pilots the 
                    Ultima Weapon in battle. Shielded by Hydaelyn's 
                    Blessing of Light, the adventurer destroys the 
                    Ultima Weapon, leaving Gaius behind in the explosion. 
                    Lahabrea defeats the adventurer himself, revealing the 
                    Calamities are part of a process to resurrect the Ascians' 
                    god, Zodiark.[38] Hydaelyn revives the adventurer and 
                    they purge Lahabrea from Thancred's body, as in the 
                    prologue vision. With the threat of Garlean invasion 
                    lifted, the Grand Company leaders declare the beginning 
                    of the Seventh Astral Era. The player's character is 
                    hailed as a hero of the same caliber as the Warriors 
                    of Light.
